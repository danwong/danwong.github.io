    I am currently working on developing features in Microsoft Azure - File Sync! I focus on writing scalable 
    features to reduce time to resolve incidents. I integrated Machine Learning algorithms to modernize the way we think
    about monitoring dependencies! :)

    I wrote two large features for Microsoft Teams iOS. This included the Voice Messaging feature which sees ~1 million messages per month!
    I also wrote location sharing messages so that you can drop a pin to meet up for coffee!
